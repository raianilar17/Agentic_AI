# Agentic AI

**Build agentic design patterns:** reflection, tool use, planning, and multi-agent workflows. </br>
**Integrate AI with external tools:** databases, APIs, web search, and code execution. </br>
**Evaluate and optimize AI systems:** performance metrics, error analysis, and production deployment. </br>

Agentic AI represents a new way of building software that leverages LLMs to complete some or all of the steps in complex tasks. </br>
Instead of generating single responses to prompts, agentic workflows enable AI to plan multi-step processes, execute them iteratively, and improve outputs through reflection and tool use. </br>
build these sophisticated AI systems from the ground up.</br>

Master **four design patterns** that power agentic AI systems:

**Reflection:** AI critiques its own work and iterates to improve quality—like code review, but automated.</br>
**Tool Use:** Connect AI to databases, APIs, and external services so it can actually perform actions, not just generate text.</br>
**Planning:** Break complex tasks into executable steps that AI can follow and adapt when things don’t go as expected.</br>
**Multi-Agent:** Coordinate multiple specialized AI systems to handle different parts of a complex workflow.</br>

Built practical implementation using Python, building each pattern from first principles before exploring frameworks, giving you the flexibility to customize AI workflows for your specific needs. </br>
learn to deconstruct business processes into agentic workflows, identifying where human-like iteration and tool interaction can automate complex tasks. </br>
Critical evaluation skills are woven throughout, build robust testing frameworks, conduct systematic error analysis, and optimize systems for production deployment.</br>
